# Simulator Project

This project provides a simulator environment using Docker containers for an Actuator, a Broker, a Monitor, and an AI-Engine, along with helper scripts for Kubernetes infrastructure.
It also works with submodules to manage dependencies, such as the Broker, Actuator, Monitor, and AI-Engine repositories.

After cloning the repository, you need to initialize the submodules using the following command:

```sh
make init-submodules
```

or

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Requirements

- Docker
- Go
- (Optional) Kubernetes and kubectl
- (Optional) WSL for Windows users

## Main Makefile Targets

- **all / setup-and-start**  
  Sets up the Kubernetes infrastructure, starts the Broker, Actuator, Monitor, and AI-Engine containers, and then runs the Go simulator. This is the main target to get everything running from scratch.

  ```sh
  make
  # or
  make setup-and-start
  ```

- **start**  
  Runs only the Go simulator. This assumes that the Kubernetes infrastructure and all required containers are already running.

  ```sh
  make start
  ```

- **start-kwok**  
  Switches to KWOK mode (simulated nodes), sets up infrastructure, starts all containers, and runs the simulator.

  ```sh
  make start-kwok
  ```

- **start-real**  
  Switches to Real mode (KIND clusters), sets up infrastructure, starts all containers, and runs the simulator.

  ```sh
  make start-real
  ```

- **run-all-containers**  
  Starts all required containers (Broker, Actuator, Monitor, AI-Engine) without running the Go simulator.

  ```sh
  make run-all-containers
  ```

- **stop-all-containers**  
  Stops and removes all simulator containers.

  ```sh
  make stop-all-containers
  ```

- **setup-kubernetes-infra**  
  Runs the script to set up the Kubernetes infrastructure.

  ```sh
  make setup-kubernetes-infra
  ```

- **help**  
  Shows a list of available targets and their descriptions.
  ```sh
  make help
  ```

## Output and Analysis

After running a simulation, the data is saved in a timestamped directory:

```
simulator/data/output/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
├── metrics.json          # Metrics from Monitor
└── logs/                 # Container logs
    ├── actuator.log
    ├── broker.log
    ├── monitor.log
    ├── ai-engine.log
    └── kubectl.log
```

**To generate plots and analysis:**

```sh
cd analyzer
make generate-plots RUN_DIR=../simulator/data/output/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
```

This creates plots and summaries in `analyzer/output/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/`.

See `analyzer/README.md` for more details.

## Container Details

- **Actuator**

  - Image: `actuator-api`
  - Container name: `actuator-simulator`
  - Dockerfile: `actuator/Dockerfile.api`
  - Listens on port: 8085

- **Broker**

  - Image: `broker:latest`
  - Container name: `broker-simulator`
  - Dockerfile: `broker/Dockerfile.api`
  - Listens on port: 8081

- **Monitor**

  - Image: `monitor:latest`
  - Container name: `monitor-simulator`
  - Dockerfile: `monitor/Dockerfile`
  - Network: `host`

- **AI-Engine**
  - Image: `ai-engine-api`
  - Container name: `ai-engine-simulator`
  - Dockerfile: `ai-engine/Dockerfile.api`
  - Listens on port: 8083

## AI Engine Activation/Deactivation

The AI Engine is now controlled via the configuration file `simulator/data/config.yaml`:

```yaml
ai-engine:
  enabled: true  # Set to false to disable the AI Engine
  ...
```

To enable or disable the AI Engine, simply change the value of `enabled` and run the simulator normally:

```sh
make start
```

## Execution Modes

The simulator supports two execution modes: **KWOK** (simulated) and **Real** (real workloads).

### Switching Between Modes

```bash
# Switch to KWOK mode (simulated - default)
./scripts/setup-mode.sh kwok

# Switch to Real mode (real workloads)
./scripts/setup-mode.sh real
```

### KWOK Mode (Default)

- **Use for**: Development, testing, POCs
- **Nodes**: Simulated via KWOK
- **Cost**: Free
- **Setup**: Fast (< 5 min)

### Real Mode

- **Use for**: Production validation, performance testing
- **Nodes**: Real Kubernetes clusters
- **Cost**: Based on cloud provider
- **Setup**: Requires pre-configured clusters

**✨ Real Mode Now Auto-creates KIND Clusters!**

For detailed information, see [README-EXECUTION-MODES.md](README-EXECUTION-MODES.md)

## Real Workloads

The simulator now uses **real workload processing** instead of dummy busybox containers. Workloads use `stress-ng` to generate actual CPU and memory load, providing:

- ✅ **Real CPU usage** (99-100%)
- ✅ **Real memory usage**
- ✅ **Real metrics** for monitoring
- ✅ **Working autoscaling** (detects real load)
- ✅ **Accurate AI recommendations** (based on real data)

For details, see [CHANGELOG-REAL-WORKLOADS.md](CHANGELOG-REAL-WORKLOADS.md)

## Notes

- The Makefile automatically builds images if they do not exist.
- Kubeconfig and other necessary files are mounted into the containers as needed.
- For WSL users, the Makefile attempts to detect and use the correct Windows home directory for Go commands.
